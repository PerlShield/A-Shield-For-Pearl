        # developer more strict than me on logins,
        # can implement erasing of data on your drives tape
        # when you attempt to decrypt passwords by providing an incorrect attempt as an if clause.
        # that can finish what is known as your licensing to use a product, so now just remember

        # it is just a license to use that laptop in exchange for money and the laptop technically is a gift
        # what costs you money is the license to use it.
        # so i'm not gonna implement an erasing data on a local boot.efi document on your i386 folder
        # because that's beyond the scope of this Shield just so you can remember that if your boot.efi
        # gets altered because of a malicious intent inside a wrong login, your license is over and your computer too,
        # so you have to go to a store and put a false face to say your license is over because you attempted to decrypt
        # a password which in many planets is considered illegal and subject of imprisonment etcetera;
        # they at an Apple Retail Store or at a Microsoft Retail Store will look at you in 2 different ways
        # i'm just wondering what happens: 1. they look at you and say it will be cheaper for you this time if you give them
        # the one that is no longer active. or 2. they say the model is not available in many stores because your face looks
        # like the one a maniac will have when doing so and so they are creeped out with you asking weird things.
        # again, i'm not using the erasing directories command (rm -R ./nameOfTheFolder) tonight because it is not my job to kill
        # Buddas but, if someone does, which also perfectly legal, just please be aware that you might be
        # disconnected from the internet forever and the data will not be recovered by forensics, so.
        # that said, edit this file at your own risk and remember everyone is protecting and nobody wants to attack
        # because the one who attacks is the one who dies, i've seen people lost over 5 computers trying to decrypt only
        # 1 password from someone they hate so much.
        # do something else, draw a picture, drink a beer, go away and come tomorrow.

# This shield either edited or in its generic form, you can sell it on a price no superior than 1,531 US Dollars
# again accept my advise, there are better shields for higher price but no lower quality under 800 US Dollars.
