# A-Shield-For-Pearl
This is a very complex shield for web usage of perl

Please when visiting BreakDownEquipment.pod 
remember to do click on raw mode to see how it works since web browsers 
don't accept .pod text markups for perl as html input.

Only fools think critical hull integrity is something to boast about down at the local space bar like drunken silly males. But a shield ensures your surviva [which is more than can be said by them].
